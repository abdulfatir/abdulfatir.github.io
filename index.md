# About

I am a second PhD student at the [School of Computing](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/), National University of Singapore, advised by Dr. [Harold Soh](https://haroldsoh.com/). I primarily work on deep generative models. Currently, I am working on learning disentangled representations, their implications and use cases. For more details, take a look at my [CV]({{site.base}}/files/CV.pdf) and my [Github profile](https://github.com/abdulfatir).

### More Information

Prior to joining NUS, I graduated with a bachelor's degree in Civil Engineering from IIT Roorkee. At IIT Roorkee, I worked at Computer Vision Lab, and Computational Biology and Translational Bioinformatics Lab. During my years as an undergrad, I participated in Google Summer of Code twice (in 2016 and 2017 and worked with Dr. [Tomas Helikar](http://helikarlab.org/)).
