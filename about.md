I am a PhD student at the [School of Computing](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/), National University of Singapore, advised by Dr. [Harold Soh](https://haroldsoh.com/). I primarily work on interpretable generative models.

### More Information

Prior to joining NUS, I graduated with a bachelor's degree in Civil Engineering from IIT Roorkee. At IIT Roorkee, I worked at Computer Vision Lab and Computational Biology and Translational Bioinformatics Lab. During my years as an undergrad, I participated in Google Summer of Code twice (in 2016 and 2017 and worked with Dr. Tomas Helikar).

### Other Interests

I like traveling and taking pictures (see [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/solitarypenman/) and [500px](https://500px.com/abdulfatir) which I sporadically update). I also used to [write poems](http://blog.abdulfatir.com/) but haven't written anything in a while. I like listening to [Coke Studio](http://www.cokestudio.com.pk/) while I work.
