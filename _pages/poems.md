Some peoms that I have written in the past.

### of longing and belonging
<h6 style="color:#828282">Jul 2022</h6>
Another daylight is slowly fading away    
An unfamiliar darkness    
Engulfing these crimson clouds    
Will the new day bring forth    
A sense of belongingness?    
Will the morning breeze    
Carry your fragrance north    
So the flowers here may bloom?    
Of the beauty of this land    
I have heard several tales    
But I blame not those oblivious of you    
For what here is more worthy of pilgrimage    
Than a glimpse of your eyes?    

### the final autumn
<h6 style="color:#828282">May 2022</h6>
i see the last summer sun    
fall into the depths of the murky sea    
but when at these crimson stains    
on my hands i look    
there's none murkier than my soul    
in this sea, i can rinse my hands perhaps    
but there's none to cleanse my soul    
    
the autumn has arrived now    
and in a deep crimson hue    
the leaves too have been stained    
with a strong gust of wind    
these leaves will fall    
the spring will then bring new life    
for these bare trees    
but there's no revival for my soul    

### the hour before nightfall 
<h6 style="color:#828282">Sep 2015</h6>
When your hair have gray streaks    
And your skin is wrinkled, withered.    
When your bones become frail.    
I'll be there in all those ebbs    
And when the water crosses the line.    
I'll be your stick so you do not fall    
And when you do fall    
My hand will be there    
Ready to hold you before all    
My hand, for you to hold    
While we walk together    
To see the last sunset along the shore    
We'll have our share of fights, no doubt    
But you'll find me closer, throughout    

All strings are frail, They may not hold.    
But I'll always cherish these memoirs of old.    
And I'll wait for you somewhere, someday,    
To spend—with you—the last hour before nightfall.    

### o slumber!
<h6 style="color:#828282">Aug 2015</h6>
O puissant! Intoxicating slumber,    
Wherefore art thou lost?    
Far and wide I dig thee,    
Through all temper and frost.    
    
Say, Beloved Sleep! Where art thou found?    
Under these lids ye silently creep,    
Fly me to a world with peace profound,    
Walking through dreams and visions deep.    
    
O Mighty Sleep! Sister of death,    
Take me with you to heights new;    
Weary I am of late with sorrows untold,    
Colorful memoirs of past make me view.    
    
Listen O Slumber! Mistress of night,    
Come hither I invoke thee,    
Bring me the skies tied to thy flight,    
Come apace here lies an impatient me.    

### a memoir may remain
<h6 style="color:#828282">Aug 2015</h6>
Soon I'll be gone with an expeditious stream,    
On a swift time torrent as flick of a dream,    
How much ever you may try you won't hold,    
An emotion seldom summons once sold.    
All marks of my existence will flow in a drain,    
Alas!    
In a nook of your heart a memoir may remain.    
    
Each soul has a given date you were oft told,    
But to my silent tears you were often cold.    
My footprint on sands you may perchance find,    
A sweet recollection may flicker through your mind.    
Tears from your eyes will then roll out in vain,    
Alas!    
In a nook of your heart a memoir may remain.    
    
The echoes of that laughter will all die off,    
A cold reminiscence will remain in mind's trough,    
To touch me then you will give out your heart,    
"It’s too late my friend," will be said by the dark.    
In the monsoon cloud, you'll miss me in rain,    
Alas!    
In a nook of your heart a memoir may remain.    

### stopping by the woods ... continued 
<h6 style="color:#828282">Aug 2015</h6>
_A tribute to Sir Robert Frost_

Desire in my heart forms a heap,        
Stunned by woods' beauty, I weep.       
But I won't stop 'cause there are,      
Acres of corn field yet to reap.        
    
Both the thoughts are still at par,       
My heart with mind is caught in war,        
Leaving the snowy woods I've to move,       
Following that bright still north star.     
    
In state of such dilemma you've,        
To make one choice and prove,       
That you can never have it all,     
How much ever you desire the grove.     
    
My wish is naive but promises are tall,     
Now they give my weary spirit a call,       
So let the white snow flakes fall.      
So let the white snow flakes fall.      

### walking alone on an empty road 
<h6 style="color:#828282">Aug 2015</h6>
I drift lifeless in this weary night,    
Not cognizant of these dark ways.    
A tear in my eye blurs my sight    
Souvenir of bright, beautiful days.    
    
I hear the sound of leaves, dry.    
Crushed—like my life—torn apart.    
A soft, muffled cry,    
I hear their echo in my heart.    
    
I turn around with a firm belief    
Of someone in this way unknown.    
But the sight multiplies my grief—    
An empty road with shadow of my own.    
    
I look up at the moon profound,    
Prepared I was, to shout aloud.    
At this happiness I just found    
When she hid behind a chunk of cloud.    

### where's the change?
<h6 style="color:#828282">Aug 2015</h6>
Where is the change? Sometimes I wonder.    
All looks the same like the valiant sun yonder.    
It still burns and gives its rays,    
Softening our hearts and lighting our ways.    
The moon still shines and follows its course.    
It’s we who’ve put ourselves behind locked doors.    
Upon these parts whenever I ponder,    
Where’s the change? They make me wonder.    
The colorful birds sitting on the trees above    
Still sing the melodies of pain and love.    
The rainbow still shines after the rain;    
It’s we who’ve flushed the happiness into drains.    
There’s still vigor in the flight of butterflies;    
Alas! We’ve chosen to shut our eyes.    
Beauty still lies in the blue bolts of thunder,    
Where is the change? Sometimes, I wonder.    

### dark illumination
<h6 style="color:#828282">Aug 2015</h6>
I'll see you, clearly, in the dark,    
Where I won't be misled,    
And blinded by the illumination,    
Where your face    
Won't be able to hide    
Your face.    
And I'll see the demons    
Residing within you.    
And will show you    
The ones I call mine.    

### solace for all
<h6 style="color:#828282">Aug 2015</h6>
When the night descends,    
Descends over the luminous city.    
The city plunges deep,    
Deep into the dungeons of slumber.    
Of slumber which hides,    
Hides beneath the dismal eyes.    
Eyes which have lost their luster, seeking,    
Seeking that rebellious solace,    
Solace which is not meant for them.    
    
Of luster lost,    
Lost to the yearning of the beloved.    
Beloved who’ll never reciprocate.    
Lost to the longing for a morsel.    
Lost from the eyes of the urchin    
Who lives on the corner of the street.    
The night has engulfed every soul,    
Every soul into its tender arms.    
Arms which are neither biased nor weary.    
Arms which will comfort both the lover    
And the urchin lying near the street.    
    
### lights out!
<h6 style="color:#828282">Aug 2015</h6>
I have to ask the hawk    
Who fell from its    
Lofty flight.    
If it was able    
To fly, again.    
If it was able    
To flap its wings    
In the very wind    
Which reeked of—    
Betrayal.    
    
I have to ask the curtain    
Which bore the abuses    
And slander.    
If it was able    
To open itself, again.    
    
I have to ask men    
If my verses    
Were ever heard.    
If they ever gave    
That soul shattering impact.    
    
I have questions umpteen    
To which I know not    
The answers.    
But I’m exhausted.    
And my lids laden    
With slumber.    
And my heart emanating    
Muffled tones.    
And there’s a cavity    
In my breast, which    
Only slumber can mend.    
But I know not    
Of this sleep.    
And I think, at times,    
It’s better, not knowing.    
I’ll embrace it now,    
So— “Lights Out!”    

### ode to mediocrity
<h6 style="color:#828282">May 2015</h6>
O mediocrity!    
By that name you're known.    
But you have    
Many titles, which you    
Call your own.    
And we, here,    
Are mediocre men    
Falling under the biggest chunk    
Of human segregation.    
The chunk of— average men.    
    
Scholars, painters, writers,    
You've devoured them all,    
As you sit    
Beside the artists    
(Even the wise ones)    
Hidden from the mortal eye,    
And when they are oblivious,    
You creep, swiftly,    
Into their work,    
Making it one of your own.    
    
You, with your sister—cliché,    
Have spread your clouds    
Far and wide.    
However—    
I apologize for cliché    
On behalf of the humans.    
'Cause we pedestrians    
Stumbled upon an idea— remarkable.    
Used it; and used again,    
Until she was born.    
    
Sometimes, I think    
The problem is within.    
Perhaps I'm afraid.    
Afraid to take the fall.    
But I've been ordinary    
For too long    
Peradventure I'll seek refuge    
Under your nemesis— extremity.    
And will confront you, someday,    
And will slay you,    
With a blade of unparalleled edge.    

### the fourth face
<h6 style="color:#828282">May 2015</h6>
There are layers,    
Covering your soul.    
Layers, meant to conceal;    
To deceive.    
Three masks, to be worn,    
In this masquerade party.    
    
The first—a facade,    
A shimmering charade    
To be exhibited,    
Before the outside world.    
A smiling portrait    
Which hides, deep, dark    
Secrets and griefs.    
Beneath the curve    
Of the lips.    
    
The second, put up    
Before family and friends    
And the people you love.    
The one full of    
Pretentious admiration    
And respect.    
    
The third, worn before    
Your own selves.    
This one with smudges,    
Of self-righteousness,    
Of broken dreams,    
Of things you wanted to be,    
Things you could not be.    
Worn to console yourself.    
    
The fourth, your real face,    
Lies, buried, deep inside    
A grave.    
A grave filled with sins.    
Where your frail soul    
Cries, lying naked,    
Away from all phoniness,    
Crumbling, under the burden    
Of life.    
Of all those masks.    

### i cried ... and no one should know
<h6 style="color:#828282">Apr 2015</h6>
After years of aridity,    
In these eyes of mine,    
There has been a flood.    
The gates holding    
All the water back    
Might have crumbled    
And given up.    
But no one should know    
'Cause I am too strong.    
    
I'd convincingly enough    
Hacked my emotions    
Until they bled    
And the streams exalted    
With their red.    
The heaven mourned    
Its heart out.    
But it didn't stop me.    
Then how can I    
Succumb to this sudden tempest?    
So, no one should know    
'Cause I am too strong.    
    
I chose solitude    
Over the throng.    
Then why have I choked    
On this pill of isolation?    
And why do I feel    
Stranded,    
Marooned?    
And why —    
Every part of me    
Seeks a soul    
So that I can share,    
And cry.    
Because tears,    
They won't make me weak,    
Will they?    

### mirror
<h6 style="color:#828282">Feb 2015</h6>
Life thriving in    
rusting soul.    
Flowing water    
dilutes blood.    
Bloodied hands,    
appear—hands purged.    
Gloomy looks    
become—laughters wicked.    
Conviction becomes innocence.    
Such transforms    
~mirror~    
Transforms such—    
Innocence becomes conviction    
Wicked laughters become—     
looks gloomy.    
Purged hands, appear—     
hands bloodied.    
Blood dilutes    
water, flowing.    
Soul rusting    
in thriving life.    

### shadow
<h6 style="color:#828282">Feb 2015</h6>
On the empty lane in this evening – dim.    
A shadow – plain, hazy, and grim    
trails ahead, encompassing all.    
Born out of the weary,    
rustic lamp beside the wall.    
It might be a complex lumen theory    
but it has washed down    
all my intentions – sinful,    
into this hue – dark and brown.    
My face is a mirror, full    
of cracks from broken dreams,    
and desires unfulfilled.    
But as I look at the shadow, it seems,    
that it is devoid of the stains,    
the darkness, and the fragility    
of my soul; and the strains    
of my attempts, and their futility.    
My heart and mind still don’t agree    
if this shadow represents a better ‘me’.    

### i am awake, i think
<h6 style="color:#828282">Feb 2015</h6>
I am awake I think,    
from this human sleep of mine.    
But the bed I slept on    
was cozy and soft,    
such that, I plunged deep, into    
the dungeons of slumber.    
    
And here I lie,    
on this wooden plank.    
And two others,    
one on either side,    
blocking my view.    
Thusly, this might not be real.    
No, it’s not.    
    
My eyes see blood    
like the sun’s against them.    
And my lids laden    
with an unseen force,    
or perhaps,    
I’m scared to open them    
wide, into the sun.    
    
Now, that I’ve opened them,    
the world appears lucid.    
I see my family, elegantly dressed.    
And my beloved!    
O what a treat to the eye she is    
in that dark dress of her’s.    
And the shimmer in her eyes!    
    
Oh wait! Is that a tear drop    
on her winsome cheeks?    
And why’s my family glum?    
Is this a sepulture I’m standing at?    
But whose?    
He might have been    
someone close to us.    
    
I’ve missed a grave news    
due to this nap of mine.    
I don’t yet know, if it’s good    
to be ignorant of the tiding.    
But it just might not be civil yet    
to ask, “Who died?”.    
The coffin’s being nailed.    
    
I’ll ask her, aside,    
when this tempest settles.    


### are we a bunch of strings?
<h6 style="color:#828282">Dec 2014</h6>
Some wise men have said,    
That the universe    
Is made of strings, tiny,    
Which vibrate in dimensions ten.    
Six extra dimensions than    
The usual three of space    
And the fourth, which is assessed    
Using a pendulum    
Oscillating in nothingness.    
    
Strings, like the ones of a guitar,    
Playing different notes    
And different symphonies    
Bosons, fermions, electrons    
And gravitons to name a few.    
This annuls racism among sub-atomics    
Since ultimately they're all threads.    
Or do you think, a boson    
Is superior to a fermion    
'cause it swings in a different plane    
Or because one of them is called    
'The God Particle'?    
    
Strings, oscillating like    
The alternation of seasons    
Strings, like the thread of relationship    
Which stretches and swings    
Between its highs and lows    
Strings, oscillating like    
The advancing and receding waves    
    
All we could be is a painting,    
A hologram, simple 3D information    
On a two dimensional plane    
Living our lives and executing functions    
As the painter intended us to.    
All we are, are threads    
Arranged in a particular fashion    
All we are is a bunch of strings!
