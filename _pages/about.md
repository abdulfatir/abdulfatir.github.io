Hi! I am Fatir, an Applied Scientist at AWS AI Labs in Berlin, where I work on time series forecasting, log analytics, and generative models. I also contribute to [GluonTS](https://ts.gluon.ai/).

**Research**: My general research interest lies in the areas of **generative models**, encompassing probabilistic generative modeling (both implicit and explicit), variational inference, unsupervised learning, and representation learning. For details about my background and research, please take a look at my <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1T9tMY1NQQTTFE2sIYXjuVDUIufE5xXB6" target="_blank">curriculum vitae</a> and my [google scholar page](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=BZ0EoqIAAAAJ&hl=en).

**Previously**: I graduated with a **PhD in Computer Science** from [NUS School of Computing](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/) where I was advised by Dr. [Harold Soh](https://haroldsoh.github.io). Prior to that, I received my bachelor's degree in Civil Engineering from [IIT Roorkee](https://www.iitr.ac.in). During my undergrad years, I also participated in Google Summer of Code in 2016 and 2017.
