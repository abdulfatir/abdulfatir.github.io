I am a fifth year PhD student at the [School of Computing](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/), National University of Singapore, advised by Dr. [Harold Soh](https://haroldsoh.com/). Prior to joining NUS, I graduated with a bachelor's degree in Civil Engineering from IIT Roorkee. At IIT Roorkee, I worked at Computer Vision Lab and [CBTB Lab](http://compbio.iitr.ac.in/). During my years as an undergrad, I participated in Google Summer of Code twice (in 2016 and 2017 and worked with Dr. [Tomas Helikar](http://helikarlab.org/)).

I primarily work on deep generative models. For details, please take a look at my [curriculum vitae](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1T9tMY1NQQTTFE2sIYXjuVDUIufE5xXB6) and my [google scholar page](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=BZ0EoqIAAAAJ&hl=en).
