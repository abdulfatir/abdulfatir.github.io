Hi! I am Fatir, an Applied Scientist at AWS AI Labs in Berlin, where I work on time series problems and generative models. 

**Research**: My general research interest lies in the area of **deep generative models**, encompassing probabilistic generative modeling (both implicit and explicit), variational inference, unsupervised learning, and representation learning. For details about my background and research, please take a look at my <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1T9tMY1NQQTTFE2sIYXjuVDUIufE5xXB6" target="_blank">curriculum vitae</a> and my [google scholar page](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=BZ0EoqIAAAAJ&hl=en).

**Previously**: I graduated with a PhD in Computer Science from [NUS School of Computing](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/) where I was advised by Dr. [Harold Soh](https://haroldsoh.github.io). I was a research intern at AWS AI where I worked with Bernie Wang, Tim Januschowski, and Alex Smola. I received my bachelor's degree in Civil Engineering from IIT Roorkee. During my undergrad years, I participated in Google Summer of Code in 2016 and 2017.
