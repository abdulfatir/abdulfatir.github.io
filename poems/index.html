They make me wonder. <br> The colorful birds sitting on the trees above <br> Still sing the melodies of pain and love. <br> The rainbow still shines after the rain; <br> It’s we who’ve flushed the happiness into drains. <br> There’s still vigor in the flight of butterflies; <br> Alas!

Sometimes, I wonder.</p> <h3 id="dark-illumination">dark illumination</h3> <h6 style="color:#828282">Aug 2015</h6> <p>I’ll see you, clearly, in the dark, <br> Where I won’t be misled, <br> And blinded by the illumination, <br> Where your face <br> Won’t be able to hide <br> Your face. <br> And I’ll see the demons <br> Residing within you. <br> And will show you <br> The ones I call mine.</p> <h3 id="solace-for-all">solace for all</h3> <h6 style="color:#828282">Aug 2015</h6> <p>When the night descends, <br> Descends over the luminous city. <br> The city plunges deep, <br> Deep into the dungeons of slumber. <br> Of slumber which hides, <br> Hides beneath the dismal eyes. <br> Eyes which have lost their luster, seeking, <br> Seeking that rebellious solace, <br> Solace which is not meant for them.</p> <p>Of luster lost, <br> Lost to the yearning of the beloved. <br> Beloved who’ll never reciprocate. <br> Lost to the longing for a morsel. <br> Lost from the eyes of the urchin <br> Who lives on the corner of the street. <br> The night has engulfed every soul, <br> Every soul into its tender arms. <br> Arms which are neither biased nor weary. <br> Arms which will comfort both the lover <br> And the urchin lying near the street.</p> <h3 id="lights-out">lights out!</h3> <h6 style="color:#828282">Aug 2015</h6> <p>I have to ask the hawk <br> Who fell from its <br> Lofty flight. <br> If it was able <br> To fly, again. <br> If it was able <br> To flap its wings <br> In the very wind <br> Which reeked of— <br> Betrayal.</p> <p>I have to ask the curtain <br> Which bore the abuses <br> And slander. <br> If it was able <br> To open itself, again.</p> <p>I have to ask men <br> If my verses <br> Were ever heard. <br> If they ever gave <br> That soul shattering impact.</p> <p>I have questions umpteen <br> To which I know not <br> The answers. <br> But I’m exhausted. <br> And my lids laden <br> With slumber. <br> And my heart emanating <br> Muffled tones. <br> And there’s a cavity <br> In my breast, which <br> Only slumber can mend. <br> But I know not <br> Of this sleep. <br> And I think, at times, <br> It’s better, not knowing. <br> I’ll embrace it now, <br> So— “Lights Out!”</p> <h3 id="ode-to-mediocrity">ode to mediocrity</h3> <h6 style="color:#828282">May 2015</h6> <p>O mediocrity! <br> By that name you’re known. <br> But you have <br> Many titles, which you <br> Call your own. <br> And we, here, <br> Are mediocre men <br> Falling under the biggest chunk <br> Of human segregation. <br> The chunk of— average men.</p> <p>Scholars, painters, writers, <br> You’ve devoured them all, <br> As you sit <br> Beside the artists <br> (Even the wise ones) <br> Hidden from the mortal eye, <br> And when they are oblivious, <br> You creep, swiftly, <br> Into their work, <br> Making it one of your own.</p> <p>You, with your sister—cliché, <br> Have spread your clouds <br> Far and wide. <br> However— <br> I apologize for cliché <br> On behalf of the humans. <br> ‘Cause we pedestrians <br> Stumbled upon an idea— remarkable. <br> Used it;

and the strains <br> of my attempts, and their futility. <br> My heart and mind still don’t agree <br> if this shadow represents a better ‘me’.</p> <h3 id="i-am-awake-i-think">i am awake, i think</h3> <h6 style="color:#828282">Feb 2015</h6> <p>I am awake I think, <br> from this human sleep of mine. <br> But the bed I slept on <br> was cozy and soft, <br> such that, I plunged deep, into <br> the dungeons of slumber.</p> <p>And here I lie, <br> on this wooden plank. <br> And two others, <br> one on either side, <br> blocking my view. <br> Thusly, this might not be real. <br> No, it’s not.</p> <p>My eyes see blood <br> like the sun’s against them. <br> And my lids laden <br> with an unseen force, <br> or perhaps, <br> I’m scared to open them <br> wide, into the sun.</p> <p>Now, that I’ve opened them, <br> the world appears lucid. <br> I see my family, elegantly dressed. <br> And my beloved! <br> O what a treat to the eye she is <br> in that dark dress of her’s. <br> And the shimmer in her eyes!</p> <p>Oh wait!
